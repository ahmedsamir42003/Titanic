# Kaggle Titanic ML Competition
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Kaggle Titanic ML competition! This competition provides an exciting opportunity to dive into machine learning competitions and get acquainted with the Kaggle platform.

## Competition Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. In this challenge, the goal is to build a predictive model that can determine which passengers were more likely to survive the disaster. The model will be trained using various features such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more.

To participate in the competition and access the competition data, simply click on the "Join Competition" button on the competition page.

## Dataset
The competition provides two datasets:

train.csv: Contains information about a subset of the passengers on board (891 passengers), including the "ground truth" - whether they survived or not.
test.csv: Similar to train.csv, but without the survival outcomes for each passenger. The task is to predict the survival outcomes for the 418 passengers in the test set.
Take some time to explore the datasets provided in the "Data" tab on the competition page to gain a deeper understanding of the available information.

## Submission Format
To submit your predictions and evaluate your model's performance, follow these steps:

* Click on the "Submit Predictions" button on the competition page.
* Upload a CSV file in the submission file format.
* The submission file should have exactly 418 entries plus a header row.

Ensure that the submission file has two columns: PassengerId (sorted in any order) and Survived (your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased).
You can submit up to 10 predictions per day.
Make sure to adhere to the submission file format guidelines to avoid any errors.
